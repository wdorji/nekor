# Nekor

Nekor provides a 3D geospatial visualization with inforgraphic trails to sacred and historical sites across the himalayan region. This project won the first ever Global Tibetan Professionals Network North America Hackathon and here is the [devpost submission](https://devpost.com/software/neko). You can try out nekor at [https://nekor.vercel.app/](https://nekor.vercel.app/).

The web app is built using the MERN stack and next js framework.

The inspiration for Neko came about from our childhood memories of going on a Nekor(གནས་སྐོར།) or pilgrimage with our grandparents to sacred sites in the himalayan region. A highlight was always hearing the stories and historical accounts of the place from the elders and we realized that with modernization, most of these stories were going to die with them so to address cultural preservation, we wanted to create a literal story map curated by elders and historians.

Each Nekor has a chosen route to follow with a list of checkpoints which when clicked shows a description of the site. The types of checkpoints are cultural landmarks, natural landmarks and recommended rest stops.
